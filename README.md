# Token Connect Game

## Getting Started

```bash
$ npm install

$ npm start
```

The application should automatically open in a new browser tab at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Running tests

```bash
$ npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```bash
$ npm run test:watch
```

## Creating a production build

If this were to be deployed and hosted somewhere:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

## Things I didn't get around to

* Proper production bundles
  * CSS extraction and minification
  * Code splitting (vendors bundle)
* Deploy and host somewhere
* Responsive CSS (wasn't in the requirements but happy to talk about it)
* Making it look prettier (CSS transitions, animations, etc.)
* Favicon
* CSS linting
* Automated end-to-end UI testing (using something like Cypress)
